# 🧙 Telegram Mini App for Dungeons & Dragons

Me and my boyfriend want to create a Telegram mini app that supports online Dungeons & Dragons games. Here you can see my progress as I develop frontend part and integrate it with backend created by him :)

## 🎯 Project Goal

This app is designed to help game masters and players manage their DnD sessions in one place - without needing additional software for character sheets, maps, or item tracking.

## 🛠️ Stack

-  React.js (Vite-based setup)
-  Bootstrap 5
-  React Router
-  Swiper.js
-  Axios
-  react-i18next
-  Redux Toolkit
-  Telegram Auth Widget

## 🚧 Project Status

Now you can create your own characters! I've finally finished character creation module, added translation library (only russian for now), integrated backend and set up authorization through Telegram API! Me and my bf tried to develop character's logic to be very competitive and customizable but still limited, so that players could get creative with their strategy. Right now I'm focused on polishing the existing features and adding desktop version. At this moment my to do list looks like this:

-  ✅ add 'roles' logic
-  ✅ add inventory page
-  ✅ add abilities page
-  ✅ add browser authentication
-  create browser version
-  add character editing
-  add bestiary to the home page

...and a lot more waiting ahead!

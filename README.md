# 🧙 Telegram Mini App for Dungeons & Dragons

Me and my boyfriend want to create a Telegram mini app that supports online Dungeons & Dragons games. Here you can see my progress as I develop frontend part and integrate it with backend created by him :)

## 🎯 Project Goal

This app is designed to help game masters and players manage their DnD sessions in one place - without needing additional software for character sheets, maps, or item tracking.

## 🛠️ Stack

- React.js (Vite-based setup)
- Bootstrap 5
- React Router
- Swiper.js
- Axios
- react-i18next
- Planning to integrate with:
  - Redux

## 🚧 Project Status

Now you can create your own characters! I've finally finished character creation module, added translation library (only russian for now), integrated backend and set up authorization through Telegram API! Me and my bf tried to develop character's logic to be very competitive and customizable but still limited, so that players could get creative with their strategy. Right now I'm fixing minor bugs, adding vibe to the UX process and moving our app to the first MVP stage. At this moment my to do list looks like this:
- add 'roles' logic
- add character editing
- add bestiary to the home page
- add inventory page
- add abilities page

...and a lot more waiting ahead!

# 🧙 Telegram Mini App for Dungeons & Dragons

Me and my boyfriend want to create a Telegram mini app that supports online Dungeons & Dragons games. Here you can see my progress as I develop frontend part and integrate it with backend created by him :)

## 🎯 Project Goal

This app is designed to help game masters and players manage their DnD sessions in one place - without needing additional software for character sheets, maps, or item tracking.

## 🛠️ Stack

- React.js (Vite-based setup)
- Bootstrap 5
- React Router
- Swiper.js
- Axios
- react-i18next
- Planning to integrate with:
  - Redux

## 🚧 Project Status

I've recently set up routing to add second page of my app and added Swiper.js slider with 'cards' animation to make it look even more like a real dnd game! Right now I'm testing backend requests and integrating server logic into frontend. At this moment my to do list looks like this:
- ✅ divide current component into smaller chunks for reusability & easier maintenance
- ✅ test backend server
- ✅ integrate it with frontend
- ✅ fix some UI flaws (submitting game-code, selecting character etc.)
- add character creation
- add inventory page
- add abilities page

...and a lot more waiting ahead!
